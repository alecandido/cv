\section{About}
Currently, my main occupation consists in the development of the quantum middleware
framework Qibo, and the related projects and applications.

After an experience as a theoretical physicist, working in the field of High Energy
Phenomenology (hep-ph) -- in particular perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) and
Parton Distribution Functions (PDF) extraction -- I moved to CERN, in the scope of its
recent efforts towards quantum technologies.\newline

Qibo is a unique opportunity to build an expanding community of fully open and openly
developed tools to empower quantum technologies labs and groups, collecting everyone's
contributions and feedback.
At its core, Qibo is an integration project, bridging together as many ingredients as
possible.
The central aim is to offer a consistent experience to its users, targeting deduplication
of as many common operations as possible, to achieve a consistent experience over a
range of complex and diverse tasks.\newline

I am also a software developer, for profession and leisure. 
I enjoy studying computer science and software engineering for fun, and committing in
the development of applications and libraries for the most disparate goals.
While mainly focused in delivering for my day job, I am also especially keen in the
tooling field, tracking the advancement and progresses in DX landscape, embarking in the
related discussions, and possibly getting involved in users' communities.
