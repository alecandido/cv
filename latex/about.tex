\section{About}
I am a theoretical physicist, working in the field of High Energy Phenomenology
(hep-ph), in particular perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD).\newline

I am also a software developer, both during my main occupation as physicist,
and for my own side projects (ranging from web technologies and user
interfaces, to more numerical and performance intensive applications).

I enjoy applying what I learn, about new tools and frameworks, to improve
several aspects of my research projects (and side projects as well).\newline

I like contributing to open source projects, participating in the development
of tools I believe to be community-relevant, joining the related discussions,
and helping other users in the usage.
