    Moderate contributions to the main \nnpdf project.
    E.g.\ fixing and improving theory covariance matrix (th covmat) generation
    and handling, or improving pseudo-data sampling in the presence of th covmat.

\subsection{\textbf{Master}}

\tlcventry{2018}{2020}{\cdt: Causal Dynamical Triangulations in 2
    dimensions}{}{}{}{
    We adopted the framework of Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT). 
    It acts essentially as an ultraviolet regulator, defining the quantum
    dynamics of gravity on a specific kind of piece-wise linear manifold, the
    triangulation.
    So we introduced on these triangulations a gauge structure, generalizing the
    pure gravity algorithm of CDT by merging it properly with the algorithms
    used for static flat backgrounds, in a way independent on the dimension of
    triangulations.
    We also implement our algorithm and run the simulations, analyzing the
    outputs and comparing them with the theoretical predictions.
