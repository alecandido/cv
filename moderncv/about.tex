\section{About}
I am a theoretical physicist, working in the field of High Energy Phenomenology
(hep-ph), in particular perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD).\newline

I am also a software developer, both during my main occupation as physicist,
and for my own side projects (ranging from web technologies and user
interfaces, to more numerical and performance intensive applications).

I like to occasionally contribute to open source projects, giving a tiny help
to the development of tools I believe to be community-relevant.
