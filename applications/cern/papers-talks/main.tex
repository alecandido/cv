\section{Publications}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Evidence for intrinsic charm quarks in the proton},
      R.~D.~Ball, A.~Candido, J.~Cruz-Martinez, S.~Forte, T.~Giani, F.~Hekhorn,
      K.~Kudashkin, G.~Magni, J.~Rojo, 
      \journal{Nature}{???}{???}{???},
      \arxiv{2208.???}{hep-ph},
      \doi{???}
      \newline
      Presenting evidence for intrinsic charm in the \nnpdf4.0 \pdf set,
      extracted using \eko and its backward evolution feature, that is able to
      evolve downward the \pdf in factorization scale, taking proper care of
      matching between different flavor number schemes, including intrinsic
      contributions.
    \item \textbf{Compact gauge fields on Causal Dynamical Triangulations: a 2D
      case study},
      A.~Candido, G.~Clemente, M.~D'Elia, F.~Rottoli,
      \journal{JHEP}{04}{2021}{184},
      \arxiv{2010.15714}{hep-lat},
      \doi{10.1007/JHEP04(2021)184} 
      \newline
      Designing a new algorithm to introduce lattice gauge fields in a
      dynamical space-time. The framework adopted to describe quantum nature of
      space-time is the Causal Dynamical Triangulations ({\small CDT}) one.
      The algorithm is general with respect to the gauge fields group and
      space-time dimension.
      A benchmark implementation is presented, in two dimension for $U(1)$ and
      $SU(2)$ gauge fields, which exhibit analytically predicted properties,
      and showcases possible directions to improve flat space lattice simulations.
    \item \textbf{Can $ \overline{\mathrm{MS}} $ parton distributions be negative?}
      A.~Candido, S.~Forte, F.~Hekhorn,
      \journal{JHEP}{11}{2020}{129},
      \arxiv{2006.07377}{hep-ph},
      \doi{10.1007/JHEP11(2020)129}
      \newline
      Discussing the problem of \pdf positivity in $\overline{MS}$ scheme. In
      order to investigate it, the behavior of the partonic cross-sections is
      analyzed, together with the change of scheme from a factorization scheme
      in which \pdf{}s are positive by definition (because linked to physical
      observables).

\section{Conferences}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Machine Learning @ GGI}
      ???,
      \tturl{???}
    \item \textbf{ISMD 2022},
      ???,
      \tturl{???}
    \item \textbf{ICHEP 2022}, 
      EKO and yadism: theory predictions for PDF fitting,
      \tturl{https://agenda.infn.it/event/28874/abstracts/20280/}
      \newline
      \eko and \yadism have been presented to the general public of high energy
      physicists, together with the whole pipeline they are integrated in, as a
      way to compute streamlined fast theory predictions, with the main target
      of \pdf fits and other analyses (but the individual tools can do more).
      The \textit{evidence for intrinsic charm} in the proton is presented as
      an early example of the success of these tools to produce original
      physics.
