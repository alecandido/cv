Title: Efficient Theory Predictions for PDF Fitting

Summary:
My thesis have been focused on theory developments for PDF fitting.
On one side, I investigated specific theory and phenomenological properties of PDFs: positivity and intrinsic charm content (leading to the published evidence for intrinsic charm in the proton).
On the other, this consisted in developing a software framework for fast and reliable theory evaluation, oriented towards an efficient and reproducible Parton Distribution Functions (PDF) fit.
Further developments on the theory side have been included as part of the framework: Missing Higher Order Uncertainty estimation, QED corrections, N3LO evolution and DIS.
