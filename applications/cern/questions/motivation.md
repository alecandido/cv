My research has always been focused on software applications to High-Energy
Physics, and in particular on performance intensive calculations.

Quantum computing provide a unique new way to deal with some problems, and
outstanding chances to improve efficiency of some critical algorithms, possibly
overcoming some present bottlenecks.

Despite being still at an early stage from the perspective of the hardware
itself, some research about quantum algorithms has already been performed.
With more and more building blocks coming, and more stable hardware appearing,
it becomes extremely interesting to answer the question of possible applications
to practical use cases, starting from the most demanding fields like HEP.

Moreover, the development of proper middleware is increasingly interesting, in
order to act as a friendly framework for other scientist and engineers to build
applications on top. I believe that my experience in projects (software project
management, packaging, profiling, and so on) would be beneficial to obtain
timely and reliable results.
