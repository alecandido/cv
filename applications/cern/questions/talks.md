1. Machine Learning @ GGI NNPDF and beyond: machine learning and statistics for
   PDF extraction, https://www. ggi.infn.it/showevent.pl?id=414
   The NNPDF4.0 methodology makes use of many ideas coming from the machine
   learning community, improving the flexibil- ity and reducing the assumptions
   on the unknown set of functions. Further developments can exploit different
   statistics approaches, to enhance the transparency of the underlying
   functional prior.
2. ISMD 2022, Theory Predictions for PDF fitting,
   https://indico.cern.ch/event/1015549/ contributions/4903597/
   A further presentation of the theory pipeline, including EKO, yadism, and
   PineAPPL, to a somewhat broader audience, since ISMD gather people from
   different fields. The evidence for intrinsic charm has also been presented.
3. ICHEP 2022, EKO and yadism: theory predictions for PDF fitting,
   https://agenda.infn.it/event/ 28874/contributions/169937/
   EKO and yadism have been presented to the general public of high energy
   physicists, together with the whole pipeline they are integrated in, as a way
   to compute streamlined fast theory predictions, with the main target of PDF
   fits and other analyses (but the individual tools can do more). The evidence
   for intrinsic charm in the proton is presented as an early example of the
   success of these tools to produce original physics.
