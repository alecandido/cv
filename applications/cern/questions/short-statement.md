My research always involved software applications in HEP, ranging from lattice
to perturbative QCD (and PDF fitting).
During my master thesis, I worked on a standalone projects, developing an
individual program for a preliminary exploration task. More recently, I switched
to applications with a broader target, and there the concept of interface
started being crucial. I tried to develop tools that would have been easy to use
and integrate wherever they are relevant, in order to factorize the effort
(providing reusable software) and provide more robust results (easy to use
also yields easy to reproduce).
About the physics topics I touched, they were all related to QCD and gauge
theories, but I like to explore both perturbative and non-perturbative
approaches, to gather a broader view about the theory itself, and its
phenomenology.
