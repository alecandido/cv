My research is mainly focused on synergies between Software and Statistics on
one side (possibly including other branches of applied Math), and Physics on
the other. Especially various applications to the field of High Energy Physics.

I consider this very relevant, because at the state of the art many specific
tasks in HEP are individually increasing in complexity, and they deserve both
new analytical insights and the most advanced technologies at our disposal.

Since no one is able to perform all these task alone, it is also crucial to
cooperate.
And to make cooperation most effective we need to develop clear and common
interfaces, as much as orchestrating the community efforts.
