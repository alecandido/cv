\section{Parton Density Functions}

While my main effort has been dedicated to the input of a \pdf fit, I am also
trying to explore new directions for a possible new generation fit itself.

The idea is to overcome the limitations of both current approaches: fixed
parameterization fits, and machine learning inspired ones.

In the case of the first one, a number of parameters are traded for the full
unknown function, essentially slicing the infinite dimensional space into a
finite dimensional one.
This impose serious limitations to the space, and might propagate data
knowledge beyond the data region.

The second one, e.g.\ using neural networks, can actually benefit from a more
suitable regularization, at the price of using something on which there is poor
analytical insight, since the complexity of the training algorithm.
\newline

\mhl{proposal} Thus the idea of using an algorithm with clear analytical
insight, to avoid black box allegation, and understand more about the physics
behind, but preserving the great achievement of a flexible functional form.

In order to do this, a more statistically driven approach can be applied,
essentially adopting the framework of Bayesian inference, with suitable
methodology and approximations to face the complexity of the problem itself,
together with the increasing amount of available data.
